## Finding Highly-cited Articles over Time

Research in conspiracy theories is only growing, so how does one stay up-to-date, while also finding the most relevant works? An AI-powered tool offering features that are more useful than simple keyword search is [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/). One of its features is the date range selection, which enables following the evolution of the research on conspiracy theories over decades. Once a decade is selected, the sorting and filtering features enable the identification of the most influential articles of the decade. 
This feature was used to find the most influential articles by decade that were listed in one of the sections of the encyclopedia article.

Concretely, when searching for [articles published before 2000](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?year%5B0%5D=1938&year%5B1%5D=1999&q=%22conspiracy%20theory%22%20OR%20%22conspiracy%20theories%22&sort=influence), we find 315 articles within a 60-year period. This search reveals that Ted Goerzel's article, _Belief in Conspiracy Theories_, is the most influential article of that time period.

[Between 2000-2009 the number of articles doubles to 612](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?year%5B0%5D=2000&year%5B1%5D=2009&q=%22conspiracy%20theory%22%20OR%20%22conspiracy%20theories%22&sort=total-citations), with the article by Sunstein & Vermeule, _Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures_, taking the top. 

In the next decade, 2010-2019, [the number more than triples to almost 2000 articles](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?year%5B0%5D=2010&year%5B1%5D=2019&q=%22conspiracy%20theory%22%20OR%20%22conspiracy%20theories%22&sort=influence). The article _Measuring Belief in Conspiracy Theories: The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale_ by Brotherton, French, and Pickering emerges as the most influential of this decade.

Finally, in the [half decade 2020-2025](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?year%5B0%5D=2020&year%5B1%5D=2025&q=%22conspiracy%20theory%22%20OR%20%22conspiracy%20theories%22&sort=influence), the total number of articles surpasses all what is written before (at the moment standing at 4500 articles), largely influenced by the research studying conspiracy theories around the Covid19 pandemic. 

Similarly to finding most relevant articles in any date range, it is possible to identify the most prolific researchers (e.g., Karen M. Douglas, Joseph Uscinski, and Jan-Willem van Prooijen), or the most relevant articles within a chosen field of study, e.g., [computer science](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?year%5B0%5D=1938&year%5B1%5D=2025&fos%5B0%5D=computer-science&q=%22conspiracy%20theory%22%20OR%20%22conspiracy%20theories%22&sort=influence).
